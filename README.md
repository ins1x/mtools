# MTOOLS for Texture Studio SA:MP

![logo](/img/logo_mtools.png)

**MTOOLS** is a filterscript that complements Texture Studio and provides a classic dialog interface with basic map editor functionality.

**MTOOLS** appeared as a result of the fact that I was missing some basic functions in Texture Studio, their list was replenished and the idea of ​​merging into one filterscript came up. The task of mtools is to provide more functions to mappers for more flexible work.

>The main menu is called by default on ALT (Can be changed in the settings)\
